    <h1>BlockChain</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> For other uses, see <em>Block chain (disambiguation)</em> by <i>vishvadeep chauhan</i>. </p>
    <p>A <b>blockchain</b> is a type of distributed ledger technology <mark>(DLT) that consists of growing lists of
            record</mark> ,
        called blocks, that are securely
        linked together using cryptography. <sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a <small>cryptographic hash of
            the previous block</small> ,
        a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by
        leaves).
        The timestamp proves that the <del>cryptographic hash of the previous block</del> block was created. Since each
        block contains
        information about the previous block,
        they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the
        ones before it.
        Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded,
        the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. <br>
        Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer(P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed
        ledger,
        where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
        Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be
        considered secure by design and exemplify
        a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]
        <br> <br> A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi
        Nakamoto in 2008[6] to serve as the public
        distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott
        Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.
        [7] The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the
        double-spending problem without the
        need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and
        blockchains that are readable by
        the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment
        rail.[8]<br>
        <br> Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such
        privatized blockchains without a
        proper security model "snake oil";[9] however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully
        designed, may be more decentralized
        and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.[4][10]

    <h3>Structure and design</h3>
    <hr>
    A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks
    that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
    retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[3][21] This allows the participants to verify and
    audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[22] A blockchain database is managed autonomously
    using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration
    powered by collective self-interests.[23] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty
    regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility
    from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing
    problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[24] A blockchain can
    maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that
    compels offer and acceptance. <sub>[citation needed]</sub> <br>

    <p> Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers: <sup>[25]</sup> </p>


    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems
        Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a cryptographically
        secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to
        implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
        Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document
        certificates to be collected into one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
        hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[14]</p>

    <br>
    <p>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto
        in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks
        without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the
        rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a
        core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the
        network.[3] <br>

        In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on
        the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[15] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from
        January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had
        exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[16] <br>

        The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
        popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[17] <br>

        According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained
        a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[18]
        Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of
        Digital Commerce. <br>

        In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
        organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with
        blockchain".[19] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a
        'game-changer' for their business.[20]</p>
